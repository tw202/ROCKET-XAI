# ROCKET-XAI-Masterthesis
This repo sontains the code that was part of a Masterthesis to develop an XAI method for Time series classification with ROCKET. The purpose of this repository is to provide the python notebook to reproduce the results and idealy further develop the explainability of ROCKET.

The whole experimental study was conducted in the google collaboratory environment (free version). If desired other data than the artificially generated can be used. The code is heavily commented, to help the usability of the fragments, although this is not a good practise in a clean code of sense.
